This program is to solve the Sudoku puzzle game save in file "soduku.txt".
By running the main.py, it will call other models to display and solve the game.
The result will print in Python console and automatically save in "sudoku_result.txt".

------------- Sublime Text issue -------------

In some IDEs like Sublime Text 3, there might be some error while taking input from user.
This is an issue for Sublime Text 3 and can be fixed by installing extra package to handle input in Sublime.
On most IDEs (including PyCharm/Spyder/ATOM) the program can run smoothly without any problem.
