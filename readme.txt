------------- Sublime Text 3 error issue -------------

In some IDEs like Sublime Text 3, there might be some random code while printing the result in console.
Under this case, please follow below steps to solve the issue:

Install ANSIescape package:
1. Ctrl + Shift + P --> type "install", select "Package Control: Install Package" --> wait a few seconds, and a new search bar will pop up.
2. In the new search bar --> search for "ANSIescape" and select it.
3. Watch the status bar in the very bottom to see when it's done installing. It should just take a few seconds. Done!

Now, to use it, click the current syntax highlighting text in the very bottom right of your Sublime Text 3 window. Choose "ANSI", as shown below.

You may also choose this from the menus: View --> Syntax --> ANSI.
